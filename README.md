# Cherrypy
CherryPy is a minimalistic yet powerful Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications. It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use, while still providing all the necessary features for developing robust web applications.

## Usage
CherryPy operates as an HTTP server that can handle incoming requests and dispatch them to the appropriate code in your application. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as handling URL routing and parameter extraction.

Some key features of CherryPy include:
- `Minimalistic` : CherryPy follows the "batteries included, but removable" philosophy. It provides a solid foundation for building web applications without imposing unnecessary dependencies or forcing specific architectural patterns.
- `Built-in HTTP server` : CherryPy includes a multi-threaded HTTP server that can be used for development and deployment. This eliminates the need for setting up a separate web server during the development phase.
- `URL routing` : CherryPy allows you to define URL routes that map to specific methods or handlers in your application. This enables clean and structured URL patterns for your application's endpoints.
- `Template engine support` : CherryPy integrates with popular templating engines such as Jinja2 and Mako, allowing you to easily separate your application's logic from its presentation.
- `Session management` : CherryPy provides built-in session management support, allowing you to store user-specific data across multiple requests. It simplifies handling user authentication, authorization, and maintaining session state.
- `Plugin system` : CherryPy offers a flexible plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality by adding custom features or integrating with third-party libraries.
- `Testing and debugging` : CherryPy includes tools and utilities for testing and debugging your web applications, making it easier to identify and fix issues during development.

CherryPy is widely used and has a vibrant community of developers. It has been around for many years and has proven to be a reliable and efficient framework for building web applications in Python.
